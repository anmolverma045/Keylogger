A Keylogger Project involves developing a software application designed to monitor and record keystrokes on a keyboard. Keyloggers are widely used in fields like cybersecurity, parental control, productivity tracking, and ethical hacking for educational purposes. The project can be a valuable learning experience for understanding low-level input/output handling, system events, and ethical programming practices.

Capture all keystrokes entered on the keyboard and store them in a secure format (e.g., plain text or encrypted logs).


Libraries/Frameworks: "pynput"


This project offers hands-on experience in programming and ethical software development, providing a comprehensive understanding of keylogging mechanisms and their applications.
